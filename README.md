Minimal Api Demo:

**1.MinimalApiDemo.BasicJWT** - simple example, no databases, even without checking the login and password, it's supposed to be a minimum, just pure token creation

**2.MinimalApiDemo.DIExample** - simple as above, but I introduced here TokenService and used IConfiguration & IOptions to access appsettings.json settings
